# Kaggle Titanic

For our final project, the <b>goal</b> is to perform a 2-label <b>classification problem</b>: to predict which <b>passengers survived</b> the tragedy. <br> [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) offers two datasets. One training (the labels are known) and one testing (the labels are unknown). The goal is to submit a file with our predicted labels saying who survived or not. <br>
